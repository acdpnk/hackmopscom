[Fast Company](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3037941/the-secret-meaning-behind-gamergates-branding?):

>those following the GamerGate saga have seemed surprised to learn that a crowdsourced mascot and logo created during the donation drive included a color scheme linked to a cartoon rape meme

>“She has long auburn or red hair, green eyes, and freckles, with her eyes often depicted as having bags underneath them due to her inconsistent sleep schedule,” according to the quasi-official GamerGate Wiki. “Her skin is a pale white due to the large amount of time she spends indoors, and she is typically depicted as being slightly overweight due to a poor diet and lack of exercise.”
>She also has a headband adorned with a four-leaf clover, 4chan’s logo, and a hoodie in purple and green stripes. **The purple and green alludes to an animated GIF called “Piccolo Dick” which shows the Dragon Ball anime character Piccolo sodomizing Vegeta, another character from the series.** (emphasis mine)

1. Who is surprised? Certainly not me.
1. If you use offensive symbolism, be prepared to people taking offense. If you didn't mean to be offensive, own up to that and *change it*. Everybody makes mistakes. Then again, this is certainly no mistake. 4chan is famous for in-jokes. There's probably people out there who align themselves with #GamerGate and didn't get that. But those who conceived it? They knew. And by now, they all know, and they still think it's a great logo. That is #GamerGate for you.
