[Learn Code the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/):

>This book is a quick super fast course in using the command line. It is intended to be done rapidly in about a day or two, and not meant to teach you advanced shell usage.

I distinctly remember taking my first steps on the command line. It's not easy to get into using it,  it's certainly not for everyone, but if you're interested at all, give this one a look. You might fall in love, as did I.
