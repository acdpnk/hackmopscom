[Michael](http://boingboing.net/2014/11/03/why-i-believe-space-exploratio.html):

>In 1946, a NASA satellite gave us the first scratchy black and white photo of one tiny segment of Earth from space, but it wasn't until 1967 that the world saw the first glorious photo of it as a big, beautiful sphere. Today we are all-too familiar with "Blue Marble" images of our home planet, but up until that time no one, in hundreds of thousands of years of human history, could envision the Earth's beauty. It has been said that what we find the most beautiful, we care for the most; images of Earth have inspired millions of people to care deeply for the health of our fragile sphere.
