I have spent the last couple of days setting up this site, polishing everything to the best of my ability in what little time I had, figuring out workflows, so that external annoyances would not keep me from blogging, and overall trying to find out where I want to go with this. Today I started posting. The site still has some rough edges, and I'm pretty sure there's still some taps I could save when publishing, but all in all I like the setup I have quite a bit.

Also, I already made friends[^1] with a gamergater. 

[^1]: and when I say "friends" I mean he [sealioned][] me on Twitter and I blocked him
