>The Soviets may have had a head start on the Americans, but by no means did that mean that their spacecraft were flight-ready. Sputnik 2 was hurriedly launched less than a month after Sputnik 1, and Laika was never intended to survive the journey. The plan was to euthanize her with poisoned dog food after several days of tests, but instead, a malfunction in the slapdash temperature control system resulted in her dying from stress and overheating.

>Throughout all of this, Laika was absolutely terrified. Her heart was beating at triple its normal rate during the launch. With no handlers to comfort her—as they had after centrifuge tests—it took much longer than usual for her to calm down. No sooner had the stress of the launch receded than Laika was exposed to the spiraling heat and humidity, in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, that would end up killing her.

I've always felt torn about Laika. When I first learned about her as a little kid, I was immediately a fan. Not only was she the first animal to orbit the earth, she also gave me hope: if a stray street dog could become an astronaut, so could the kid who always got picked last for the team in physical exercise. And yet – she *died* up there, alone and afraid, and she never had a chance. When I was younger, it was easier to accept that this might have been a necessary sacrifice. Today, I'm not so sure.
