[Victoria Turk](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/were-sexist-toward-robots):

>But what’s weirder than our insistence on assigning gender to non-sentient machines is that we then sometimes treat them differently as a result. We’re sexist to robots. It would be funny in its absurdity, if it didn’t so harshly reflect the prejudices already ingrained in human society, and risk entrenching them even further.

Let's not kid ourselves: corporations building robots will play to this. They will build "female" nurse bots and "male" security bots, to make their products more acceptable to users. Yay capitalism, thwarting the advancement of the human race since forever.

But it doesn't have to be like this. For a robot, a gender is just a label that's stuck on. What matters is what is inside, and that has nothing to do at all with it's perceived gender. Once we truly share our lives with robots, look at them as peers, we might actually come to realize that. And when our culture, our languages, our *thinking* have adopted, we might be ready to accept that the same has been true for ourselves all along.
