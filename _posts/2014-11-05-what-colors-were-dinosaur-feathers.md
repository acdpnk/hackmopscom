[Becky Ferreira](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/what-colors-were-dinosaur-feathers):

>“Up until now, the evolution of feathers was mainly considered to be an adaptation related to flight or to warm-bloodedness, seasoned with a few speculations about display capabilities” Koschowitz said in a statement.

>“I was never really convinced by any of these theories,” she continued. “There has to be some particularly important feature attached to feathers that makes them so unique and caused them to spread so rapidly amongst the ancestors of the birds we know today.”

>Koschowitz thinks that feature was the astute color vision of dinosaurs, which may have been a lot more sophisticated than ours. Feathers allow for a diversity of colors and iridescence that skin and fur do not. Perhaps dinosaurs evolved feathery plumage because they were able to appreciate a much larger range of colors than other clades could—including mammals.

That's an interesting theory I hadn't heard before. Also, the fact that scientists can determine (with reasonable certainty) the color of the plumage on an [animal](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx) that hasn't been around for 150.000.000 years blows my mind.
