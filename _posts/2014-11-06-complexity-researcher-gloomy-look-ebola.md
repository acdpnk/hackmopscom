[Michael Byrne](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-complexity-researcher-offers-a-gloomy-look-at-the-ebola-outbreak):

>The news cycle has moved on, it seems, yet Ebola is still kicking. According to a new statistical analysis, it's now kicking harder than ever.

>The mortality rate for the current outbreak holds at near 70 percent—higher than the WHO’s predicted 50 percent—while the rate of new infections remains exponential.

>The unsettling conclusion of the analysis, published in the current issue of Complexity, is that the r_0 value (the number of secondary cases generated by every primary case) for the West African Ebola outbreak has recently begun increasing again.

For people outside West Africa, Ebola is not dangerous right now. But it's not something we should ignore, either. Panicking over [brown people sneezing][1] is not a good response[^1]. Neither is ignorance.
