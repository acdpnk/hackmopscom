[Becky Ferreira](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-is-the-best-image-ever-of-planetary-formation):

>The HL Tau star system is giving birth to a litter of planets, and thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, we have an extraordinary baby picture to fawn over.

>Indeed, the image clearly shows the concentric rings marking where planetesimals are beginning to accumulate and mature into full planets. Given that HL Tau is a young Sun-like star located a full 450 light years away, this resolution of 35 milliarcseconds is astounding. In familiar Earth-based terms, the resolution is roughly the equivalent of producing a high-res image of a penny from over 110 kilometers away.

I'm so looking forward to all the other images this telescope is going to produce over the next years.
