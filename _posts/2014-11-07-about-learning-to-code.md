I just added the link to this site to my social media bios, to my surprise finding the space occupied by my old tumblr[^1]. Scrolling through the pages, I found a post lamenting the fact that, at that time, I really wanted to learn how to code, but I really did not know how to get started. The date on that article is 2012-02-26. I don't exactly remember how or when I found that starting point I was so desperately looking for, but there's a post from september of that year indicating that I had started getting my feet wet. So it's been probably a little less than 2Â½ years since I wrote my first real code[^2].

I'm so glad I went down this path. The first few steps were hard, but it's been a blast ever since. Not always easy, not always enjoyable[^3], but overall well worth the effort. I've got a long way to go (which is great, because I'm the happiest I've ever been with what I do every day), but I've also come a lot further than I would have thought was possible in february 2012.

[^1]: I'm not going to link it, because it just wasn't very good (also mostly german). If you think you need to see it -- it's not hard to find.

[^2]: Not counting the silly little BASIC programs I wrote on my [TI-83](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series) back in school.

[^3]: *cough*, Java, *cough*
