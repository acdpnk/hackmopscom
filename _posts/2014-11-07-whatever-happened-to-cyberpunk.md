[Damien Walter](http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/nov/07/cyberpunk-william-gibson):

>I wasn’t reading William Gibson to escape reality, I was reading him because his writing was the best description I could find of the reality I was growing up in. It wasn’t predicting the future that made Neuromancer important. It was charting, through the metaphors of sci-fi, the psychological reality of a society being profoundly disrupted by technology that made Gibson’s writing exceptional.

I wouldn't have thought of putting it like that myself, but this is pretty much how I feel about my (pretty new) fascination with transhumanism[^1].

>Gibson’s idea of cyberspace, and the virtual reality technology used to access it, weren’t a literal prediction of the future, but as metaphors they did accurately capture our disembodied relationship to technologies such as smartphones and tablet computers. Our bodies are staring, blank-eyed in to glowing lights behind panes of glass, while our minds are navigating intense, complex, immersive digital realities.

Ever since I started thinking of myself as a computer person, I found the idea of cyberspace laughably cute. Sit in a chair in *cybergoggles* and *cybergloves* to read fucking Wikipedia? Yeah right. But put like this, it starts to make sense again.

Overall a very interesting article. I should really give Gibson another look.

[^1]: Which is really a ["futurist ideology and movement"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) rather than a literary genre -- also, to be honest I don't know much about it. All I can say is it fascinates me.
