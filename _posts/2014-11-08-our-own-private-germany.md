[Ole Schulz](https://medium.com/matter/our-own-private-germany-6ce44ac93a7b):

>“For the left, it was not easy to accept the fall of the Wall. The GDR’s socialism may have been an absurd system, but it was also the only alternative to capitalism. I think capitalism was more human back then because it had to compete with socialism. With the collapse of the Eastern bloc, an era without utopias began.

>“At the very least we got to experience a few years of anarchy in East Berlin, until the new order was established. Anyone who wanted had plenty of room to play around and fulfill themselves. And we — a group of young West Berliners with some new friends from the East — occupied two abandoned houses.

A great series of written portraits, of people who witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the strange times that followed firsthand. The photos are awesome, too. By Kati Krause and Ole Schulz.
