I'm old enough to potentially remember the fall of the Berlin Wall, but I don't. My younger brother once told me he remembers "Trabbi Day", the day the first wave of [Trabbis](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabbi) -- the characteristic baby blue East German plastic cars -- showed up in our street, but I don't remember that either. In fact, I don't remember the iron curtain at all. What I *do* remember is its *absence*.

At first, it was strange. In elementary school, although the GDR was gone by then, all of our maps as well as my treasured children's atlas showed Germany one way:
{% include image.html src="deutsche-teilung.png" description="Inner German Border, by Alexrk2 [CC-BY-SA-3.0], via Wikimedia Commons" link="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Karte_Innerdeutsche_Grenze.png" %}

I couldn't find one I can link, but the map I remember the clearest had a big, fat green "Border" line through the middle, bigger than those between West Germany and the rest of western Europe. On this map, the GDR, like West Germany, had captions, but it was shaded green. Everything about this map told you the GDR was the occupied half of Germany, of us[^us].

Except that it wasn't, no more. But such was my everyday experience as a child in the early 90's: There was Germany and there was "the former GDR". At that point, all the adults around me had lived through decades of separation, most of them never having experienced a time without the Wall. For my parents it must have been a huge deal when they took their first vacation "dr√ºben". They would come home and talk about bad roads and villages where all but the last couple of houses at the end of main street were the same color[^color]. That was around '00, more than ten years after the fall. To me, the "former GDR" was still the mysterious country *beyond the Wall*.

Today, as we celebrate the 25th anniversary of it's fall, I no longer think of Germany as "West Germany plus former GDR". I have crossed the big, fat green border of my childhood multiple times myself. But the more I learn about the world in general and Germany's past in particular, the more I am amazed about the fact that I can do so.

Today, thanks to the [Schengen Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement), I can even visit other european countries without the border controls I remember from my youth. The fact that just now there are people in this country, with this history, who want to abolish the Schengen Agreement, who want *fucking borders* in Europe, is utter madness to me and makes me sick to my stomach.

[^color]: This is one of the most recited west german legends about the GDR, and I have no idea wether it's true. It says that a certain amount of paint would be allocated to a community, by someone far away in some office who had no idea how much paint was actually needed. Sometimes, the paint wouldn't be enough, and you'd get the half-painted houses. Other times, it would be too much, but since there was no official way to handle leftover paint it had to be used up, so they'd start painting anything they could find.
[^us]: I don't think of myself as *german*. I live in Germany, but states and -- especially -- borders are artificial constructs we should abolish rather sooner than later, as far as I am concerned.
