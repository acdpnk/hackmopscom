[Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_9_in_German_history):

>1923: The failed Beer Hall Putsch, from 8 to 9 November, marks an early emergence and provisional downfall of the Nazi Party as an important player on Germany's political landscape. Without sufficient preparation Hitler simply declared himself leader in Munich, Bavaria. Hitler's march through Munich was stopped by Bavarian police who opened fire. Sixteen nationalists and four policemen were killed. Only after 1930 would Hitler gain significant voter support, a process that would culminate in the Nazis' electoral victory of 1933.

>1938: In what is today known as Kristallnacht[^pogrom] (or The Night of Broken Glass), from 9 to 10 November, synagogues and Jewish property were burned and destroyed on a large scale. More than 400 Jews were killed or driven into suicide. The event demonstrated that the antisemitic stance of the Nazi regime was not so 'moderate' as it had appeared partially in earlier years. After 10 November ca. 30,000 Jewish people were arrested, hundreds of them died in concentration camps or died afterwards.

Because I wrote about the Fall of the Berlin Wall [earlier](http://acid.pink/on-the-25th-anniversary-of-the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall/), the other important events in German history that occurred on this date should not go unmentioned either. Especially [*Reichspogromnacht*](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht)[^pogrom] should never, ever be forgotten. November 9th is not a date to wave flags and be proud of being German, as so many of the *Mauerfall*[^fall] celebrations do. There are even, today, in Germany, Nazis in the streets, spreading their thinly veiled hate.

[^pogrom]: I prefer *Reichspogromnacht* to *(Reichs)kristallnacht*, because it was not about broken glass -- it was about humans being hurt, and killed, livelihoods and lives being destroyed, and it was just a taste of things to come. *Kristallnacht* sounds belittling to me.

[^fall]: *Mauerfall* is German for the fall of the Berlin Wall.
