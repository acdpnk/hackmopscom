>My first day of high school was also the first time I really embraced the idea that you could change your whole image just by changing your clothes. I decided it was finally time for me to be punk rock, and I chose the most Punk 101 outfit imaginable: black T-shirt, plaid skirt, fishnets, boots. It seemed simple enough to execute, something to get me in the door as I amassed a collection of studded belts and patches. Unfortunately, execution is everything, and I wound up looking more like a slightly edgy nun. The fishnets were easy enough, but the plaid skirt I made in summer camp came down to my knees. It turned out I didn’t own a black T-shirt, so I had to borrow something from my mom, a ¾ sleeved boat neck thing from Banana Republic that sat too baggy across my chest. The boots were also my mom’s elastic ankle boots. I hadn’t yet saved up for the Doc Martens. Suffice it to say, the punk contingent did not embrace me that year.

>I figured it couldn’t just be me, so I asked some friends if they had similar experiences. Most of us tried valiantly, as teenagers, to manage our image through clothes—and unsurprisingly, lots of us didn’t seem to know what we were doing.

>…

>Even when we’re not trying to present anything, we wind up saying something. That girl with the cheap highlights may not be able to afford better ones, but she also might just like how they look, and not realize that other people consider it a marker of class. When I talked to my friends about our inept fumblings with crafting an image, one refrain kept coming up: “Nobody told me.” We may wear or do things not because we get great reactions, but because we’ve never received feedback at all.

Ever since I gave up the goth look of my depressive late teens and early twenties I've had no distinct style to identify with. I miss that. But at the time, it was pretty much like this.
