[Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain):

>A matrioshka brain is a hypothetical megastructure proposed by Robert Bradbury, based on the Dyson sphere, of immense computational capacity. It is an example of a Class B stellar engine, employing the entire energy output of a star to drive computer systems. This concept derives its name from Russian Matrioshka dolls.

>Such a structure would be composed of at least two but typically more Dyson spheres built around a star, and nested one inside another. A significant percentage of the shells would be composed of nanoscale computers (see molecular-scale computronium). These computers would be at least partly powered by the energy exchange between the star and interstellar space. A shell (or component, should a Dyson swarm be the design model used) would absorb energy radiated onto its inner surface, utilize that energy to power its computer systems, and re-radiate the energy outwards. The nanoscale computers of each shell would be designed to run at different temperatures; shells or components at the core could be nearly as hot as the central star, while the outer layer of the matrioshka brain could be almost as cool as interstellar space.[citation needed]

>The idea of the matrioshka brain violates none of the currently known laws of physics, although the engineering details of building such a structure would be staggering, as such a project would require the "disassembly" of significant portions (if not all) of the planetary system of the star for construction materials.[citation needed]

Can you imagine such a thing being out there? The [computronium](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium) layers would make it all but invisible to our telescopes. There's no scientific basis to this, but I can't help but wonder whether the answer to the [Fermi Paradox](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) might be that this is what E.T. looks like -- a self-contained stellar scale computer.
