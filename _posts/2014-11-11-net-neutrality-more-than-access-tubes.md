[Danah Boyd](https://medium.com/message/net-neutrality-is-sooo-much-more-than-access-to-the-tubes-2344b1e9f220):

>All around us, I’m watching core principles of the internet sputter as key services crack. Consider email, the first “application” of the internet. In the 1960s, early incarnations of email weren’t interoperable across systems. With the rise of the ARPANET, email started to get standardized, making it possible to communicate across servers. By the time I got online, there was the closed AOL universe that didn’t talk to anyone and then there was the rest of the internet where anyone who could get access to a server, whether it be a university server or a prodigy account, could talk to anyone else via email. I took this for granted. Many of us still take this for granted, even as this reality is crumbling around us.

I used to think of openness, interoperability and net neutrality as "core principles" of the net, too. They certainly are at the core of why I love it. But describing them as such makes it seem like they are natural forces, fundamental building blocks of the conglomerate of technology and human endeavor we call the Internet. But if that was the case, the Internet could not exist without them. Tragically, though, it can, it just won't be the Internet I and many others love. The Internet, driven by these core principles and driving them in return, <strike>was</strike> is a huge step forward for humankind, and we're about to downgrade it to The Same Old Shit (with computers).
