As I am writing this, [Philae][], [Rosetta's][] little lander, is for all intents and purposes minutes from touching down on Comet [67P][]. 67P is also known as Churyumov–Gerasimenko, which I happen to know because I memorized that name when Rosetta took of, more than ten years ago. I am so. incredibly. excited. To imagine that this little spacecraft made it's way from here to that tiny rock[^rock] some 500 million kilometers away and managed to achieve orbit is mind blowing on it's own. To think that something will land there? How awesome is that?

Excuse me, I need to watch the stream now.

[^rock]: 67P has on the order of 5km diameter. As far as spacerocks go, that is *tiny*. And yes, I know it's not a [rock][].
