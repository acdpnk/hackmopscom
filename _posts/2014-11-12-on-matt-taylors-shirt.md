### …And Why I Think It's a Problem

During today's [Philea Landing][], Project Scientist [Matt Taylor][] appeared in various media wearing a rather unconventional shirt:

I think that it was not ok for him to wear that shirt, and I want to try to explain why. But before I do so, let me make one thing clear: This is not an attack on Matt Taylor's person. For all I know he's a nice guy. I do *not* think he meant to be offensive -- and that's exactly why I think he needs to be called out.

### What You Mean to Say and What You Say…

…are not necessarily the same. I don't think Mr. Taylor meant to say anything with his shirt other that what an awesome and cool dude he is, and how much he doesn't give a fuck about dresscodes and putting more conservative people off. And maybe, in a [perfect world][], that would have been what he actually had said. But it's not that easy. The world we actually live in is one where women are routinely discriminated against, *especially* in male dominated fields such as everything STEM[^STEM]. And in this world a lead scientist on a stage with semi-nude women on his shirt says something different. Where women are already constantly objectified and attacked based on their sexuality, a display of sexualized women is not a neutral statement -- it is reinforcing the diregard of women as people.

Many people will disagree with my point of view. They will say that there's nothing wrong with naked women[^agree] and therefore nothing wrong with naked women on a shirt[^disagree]. If you are one of these people, please consider this:

I am asking you: is this, in your opinion, a good message to send? Because obviously that's how it was understood.

A male lead scientist wearing a sexist shirt at work would be a problem any day. A male lead scientist wearing a sexist shirt on stage the day a historic scientific achievment takes place is a catastrophe, because it says loud and clear that there is no place for women in STEM, other than as half-naked decoration, and it does not matter one bit whether Matt Taylor wanted it to or not.



**Update**: He [apologized][].
