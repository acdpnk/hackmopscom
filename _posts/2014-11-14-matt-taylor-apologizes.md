>"The shirt I wore this week… I made a big mistake, and I offended many people. And I'm… very sorry about this."

Earlier today, Matt Taylor publicly apologized for his [shirt fuck-up][]. His apology could certainly be approved on, but at least it seemed sincere to me, and he aced the part where he did not try to blame it on the people who were being offended. I'd love to get a public statement acknowledging *what* went wrong, but I think thus far he handled the situation ok. Then again, I'm not the one who get's to judge that.

Bottom line: Everyone fucks up *sometime*. Stand up to it, learn, repeat.
