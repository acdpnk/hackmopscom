There's one thing I think I should add to what I wrote earlier about [Matt Taylor and his sexist wardrobe choice last Wednesday][shirt]. ***Matt Taylor is not a demon***. While his mistake is kind of special in that he made it on stage during a globally streamed event, it is not *uncommon*. Quite the opposite -- if you are male by any definition, you have almost certainly made the same kind of mistake, and more than once. Without thinking much of it you did something sexist. If you are lucky you noticed it or got called out. Probably not, because that is how our society works. We are raised to be sexist. We are raised to think sexism is normal. If we have a penis, we are raised to believe that sexism is our birthright.

People who do sexist things should be called out. You should absolutely try your best to *not* be sexist, but don't make the mistake to think that you are immune. You *will* slip, and there's nothing you can do about that -- so be prepared to apologize and learn.
