[Randi Harper](http://randi.io/wp/archives/86):

>This post is dedicated to all of the people that think sexism in tech doesn’t exist, that harassment isn’t a big deal, that trolling is harmless and funny, and that the gender disparity in tech is due simply to biology.

>I originally posted my story on Facebook and later on imgur under the title [Abusing Women is the New Normal](http://imgur.com/a/5k4P8). It’s the first time I ever publicly discussed everything that had happened. I told the shorter version of my story there, and I’m going to tell you the longer version today. Trigger Warnings abound.

>Next year, I will have been in an abusive relationship for 2 decades, and I do not plan on leaving. I love my partner, and even though the situation seems hopeless to some, I’m going to hang in there, because I want to believe that it’s going to get better. Some people think it’s my fault that I’m treated this way. Others don’t think there’s any problems at all, because I’ve done such a good job of hiding my bruises. Some tell me I should leave, but I’ve hung in there this long. If I left, what would I do? Where would I go? We’ve had some good times. Maybe things can change. Maybe if I work hard enough, if I fight hard enough, things will get better. Bruises fade, after all.

>I’m in an abusive relationship with tech, and this is my story.
