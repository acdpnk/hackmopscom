>But most of all, I really, genuinely wish Taylor had picked any of so many other options for a loud, provocative shirt: something thematically-appropriate and maybe even geek-hilarious. I wish this because it makes me sad that my unreserved giddiness about the Philae lander is tainted with yet another tiny and idiotic bit of sexism to ignore. I'm irritated that as I paw through fresh data releases, I wonder if this shirt reflects an uncomfortable working environment for the women on the Rosetta team. I'm annoyed that I'm distracted from the astonishing, impressive science being done by the Rosetta team to write about something as ridiculous as a scientist having a flawed sense of fashion.

Couldn't agree more.
