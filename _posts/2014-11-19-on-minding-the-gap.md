I just read through [yesterday's post](http://acid.pink/2014-11-19-pullquotes-in-jekyll/) again, and let's just say that in retrospect I wasn't exactly, uh, *happy* with it. In fact, my first impulse was "perhaps this is just not for me and I should stop". This is not my first website (or blog), and I've had this moment a couple of times. You'll notice that none of my other sites are maintained any more.

Luckily, I had just found Rose Ames' excellent blog [Superluser](http://rose.github.io/). She has a very inspiring [post](http://rose.github.io/posts/in-which-i-mind-the-gap/) I happened to read yesterday, so it was still fresh in my memory.

I wont say that she turned things around for me, but her words certainly fell on fertile ground. I have been learning *a lot* in the last couple of years, and one of the most important lessons I learned is perseverance. Sometimes it feels like that's all there is to it: keep trying. For coding this is especially true -- often it's 95% pulling hairs and 5% typing frantically. You figure it out eventually, but before you get there you have to go through the Valley of [Wat]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.assets }}wat-gigantic-duck.jpg).

Yesterday's post could certainly have been better, but that's not the point. It's not what I'm doing this for. I'm doing this because to write good stuff, you first have to write a whole lot of bad stuff.

I think my worst posts are already written, but the good ones are still to come. In the meantime I plan to keep myself busy with the mediocre ones.
