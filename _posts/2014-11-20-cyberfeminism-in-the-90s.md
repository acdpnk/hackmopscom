[Claire L. Evans](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/we-are-the-future-cunt-cyberfeminism-in-the-90s):

>In the cultural aftermath of Gamergate, I’ve been holding onto CyberFeminism and its fruits as totems for a saner parallel world. It consoles me to see that while technology has always been gendered, the seeds of possibility have been there from the beginning. We can use technological tools to build the landscapes of our dreams, rather than to model the constructs of our existing reality. It’s not too late for us. While the past’s failed utopian aspirations demonstrate what could have been, they also show us what we could still become.

Thinking about taking the mantle of "CyberFeminist" – sounds like a movement I could get on board with.
