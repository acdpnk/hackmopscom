I'm thinking about trying a new slug[^slug] style. Here's an actual link from the blog, in the style I use now:

<a href="http://acid.pink/2014-11-16-thanks-to-that-shirt-we-may-get-a-shirt-celebrating-women-in-science/">http://acid.pink/2014-11-16-thanks-to-that-shirt-we-may-get-a-shirt-celebrating-women-in-science/</a>

Here's the link to this post, with proposed new style[^slugstyle]:

<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.permalink }}">{{ site.url }}{{ page.permalink }}</a>

The pros are shorter permalinks without having to use url shorteners. The cons are less transparent permalinks, that don't give any clue about what they used to point to should this site go dark. Which is ironic, because the reason I started thinking about this is that I want more persitence, and therefore thought about a way of getting short urls without having to resort to a shortener. The problem with these services is that when they go away, you have no way of finding out where the short url you're trying to follow originally resolved to. The link is broken beyond repair. Add to that equation the fact that the TLD ```.ly```, for example, belongs do [Libya][], which is not exactly known for political stability, and the generally rather short livespan of most internet services, and what you get is a recipe for accellerated [link rot][].

That is not what I want. One reason I am not just using a service like tumblr or blogspot is that I want to have a more sustainable system. As long as I control acid.pink and people still use http, i can make this site available on any webserver without modification, and all links out there pointing to it will keep working[^services]. 

So the question comes down to this: Do I need short links? Because if not, the more transparent but long and unwieldy style I have been using up until now is probably preferable.

I haven't decided yet. If you have thoughts on this I'd love to hear from you.

[^slugstyle]: The slug this post is using is a [Base36][] encoded UTC timestamp. Short and as good as collision free.
[^services]: Nothing wrong with Wordpress et al, you can have the same kind of persistence there, even if they go away, it's just harder to migrate -- in exchange, you don't have to use the command line for blogging.
[Libya]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ly
[link rot]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot
[^slug]: The [*slug*][] is the "article name" part of the url
[*slug*]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug
[Base36]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_36
