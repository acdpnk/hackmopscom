Jason Snell has a longish review of the iPad Air 2 on his website [SixColors][]. If you enjoy in-depth reviews of Apple Hardware you should probably read it.

In it, Jason comments on the quality of professional software for the iPad platform:

>[…] and every time I try to use a professional tool with my iPad I end up getting frustrated at how much slower the touch interactions are than just using an old-fashioned keyboard and mouse on my Mac. For the iPad to truly be a productivity tool, it needs to allow me to be roughly as productive as I can be on my Mac—and right now for most of my uses it’s just not. The hardware is willing, but the software is (in many cases) still too weak.


I would agree with that, but I also think it's worth mentioning that I, personally, already find myself reaching for my iPad rather than the Mac for certain tasks, because they are more naturally (and, therefore, more productively) solved there. Reading everything longer than a couple of paragraphs is the most obvious example, but one that's more indicative of my point is [Transmit for iOS][] and what it enables me to do. I love the command line and am quite proficient with it, so imagine my surprise when I found myself reaching for the iPad to upload a picture to one of my servers[^Transmit].

The point being less that Transmit is awesome (it is), but that while there's still lots of room for improvement the iPad is already an awesome platform.




[^Transmit]: I don't have the [Mac version of Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) -- maybe it would be different if I did
