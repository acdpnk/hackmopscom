[Tom Brooks-Pollock](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/11252632/Bedroom-bound-quadriplegic-develops-drone-to-see-the-world.html):

>A quadriplegic man who is confined to his bedroom has used his computing expertise to see the world from his bedroom, by flying a camera-mounted drone up to thousands of miles.

>…

>"For every killer drone you show me, I can show you a drone that is saving lives all around the world.

>"If I can help change the public view on drones, that would be great and I'd be happy to do it.

>"They expand my universe in a way that I would never be able to do using my physical self.”
