[Carolyn Cox](http://www.themarysue.com/vagina-peach-tech/):

>Austen Heinz, the CEO of Cambrian Genomics and part-owner of Sweet Peach Probiotics (a startup founded by 20-year-old Audrey Hutchinson) presented at the conference alongside “tech dude” Gilad Gome.

> …the pair explained that Sweet Peach “hacks” a vagina by using DNA printing technology to replace its “natural odors” with a more mouthwatering scent. 

>To recap: not only did Heinz and Gome take verbal credit for Hutchinson’s ideas in front of an elite tech audience; they chronically and perhaps fatally misrepresented her company. Where a woman saw an opportunity for women to take charge of their reproductive health, Heinz and Gome saw an opportunity to reduce women’s bodies to the Other. And then, instead of apologizing, Heinz made a rape joke.
