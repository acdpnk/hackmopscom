>It seems like a reasonable question: Does the brain, physiologically speaking, experience virtual worlds differently? After all, we’re attuned to sensory inputs not as discrete packages, but as entire suites involving subtle combinations of senses intermingling with memories. Compared to computers, we are not so easily tricked.

>This is the basic question posed in a new paper published in this week’s edition of Nature Neuroscience. Courtesy of a team of brain scientists based at UCLA and led by physicist and neurobiologist Mayank Mehta, the study concludes that, yes, at least in terms of spatial mapping and memory-making, our brains handle virtual worlds very differently than real worlds. This may have big implications.
