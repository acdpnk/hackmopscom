Jessica Pishko:

>I’ve always known that I was a good patient. In fact, I saw it written on one of my medical charts when I broke my ankle in my 20s. “Pleasant patient,” it said at the top, and the memory itself is also pleasing. I like to think that I received this praise because I walked on a broken ankle to an X-ray machine, convinced that if the nurse thought I should be able to walk, I should.

>A history of depression is different, though. There is no being brave, there is no fighting through it.

>…

>Finally, someone had confirmed what I had known about myself for some time: that I was unpleasant to be around. I didn’t even like being around myself.

>I knew there was something wrong with me, and now I knew people could tell. The trouble with depression, however, was that I was unsure what the wound was. I couldn’t tell someone what hurt. I never actually felt depressed; I generally felt anxious, and I kept most of my stranger habits secret, which I could because I was single and lived alone.

>I tried different antidepressants. I became a yoga teacher. I met my husband. And then I declared myself “cured” and stopped. Depression was, I decided, just a feeling, something temporary that would pass.

Everyone thinks that. And for some lucky ones it's actually the case.
