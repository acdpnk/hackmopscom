>**Rocket/Payload**: A Delta IV Heavy will launch the Exploration Flight Test (EFT-1) mission for NASA, the first flight of the Orion Spacecraft.

>**Date/Site/Launch Time**: Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014, from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla. Liftoff is targeted for 7:05 a.m. EST, at the beginning of a 2-hour, 39-minute launch window.

>**Mission Description**: The flight will take Orion to an altitude of approximately 3,600 miles above the Earth’s surface, more than 15 times farther than the International Space Station’s orbital position. By flying Orion out to those distances, NASA will be able to see how Orion performs in and returns from deep space journeys.

[Orion][] will be the first spacecraft since [Apollo][] that is capable of transporting humans beyond Earth's doorstep[^doorstep]. About fucking time -- Apollo's last flight was in '72, more than 40 years ago.

[^doorstep]: The maximum operational height of the [Space Shuttle](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle) was a pitiful 650 km, while the Moon is just under 400.000 km away.
