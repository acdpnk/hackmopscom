>Forty years ago, Earth beamed its first postcard to the stars.

>The message left our home planet on a warm and sticky mid-November day in Puerto Rico. It has been flying through the galaxy at the speed of light ever since, and in about 25,000 years will arrive at a cluster filled with more than 300,000 stars.

>Unlike the radio signals that had been leaking from Earth since the late 1930s, this postcard was the first deliberate transmission to an alien civilization. Written in a way meant to be decipherable by extraterrestrial beings, the message contained some key information about the species that had sent it.

>“It was a message that would actually inform anyone who did receive it that we existed, and tell them a little bit about what we were like,” says my dad Frank, who had the responsibility of constructing and sending what’s now known as the Arecibo Message. “And it was also a message to ourselves in that it showed what an intelligent civilization can do to contact other civilizations.”

>...

>“When we sent the last character, and it stopped and we went back to that steady tone, everybody was crying,” Dad says. “We were hearing what it would be like to actually contact another world. That was what that sound was. It had the aura of human beings doing something marvelous that involved the whole cosmos.”

If you're remotely interested in this kind of stuff take the time to read the whole article -- well worth it.

Here's the message, but seriously -- read the article.
