Deep Space probes (anything headed further away from the sun than Mars[^mars]) are generally powered by thermoelectric generators, wherein heat from the nuclear decay of plutonium is converted to electric energy. Solar power is not an option for these craft because the sun's power drops rapidly over distance. To generate the same power a solar panel of 1m<sup>2</sup> in Earth's orbit has to be 25m<sup>2</sup> at Jupiter (5 times Earth's distance from the sun) and 100m<sup>2</sup> at Saturn (10 times Earth's distance from the sun), and it get's worse from there. With today's solar panels, it's simply not feasible to power a spacecraft in the outer Solar System.

Now [NASA is running low on plutonium][low]. While the US have plenty weapons- and reactor-grade plutonium (about [90 tonnes][]), NASA has only about 35kg left, just enough for a handful of thermoelectric generators. The problem is that plutonium going into nukes and reactors (Pu-239) and plutonium going into spacecraft (Pu-238) are very different. In an ironic twist of fate a little bit of spacecraft fuel is produced as "waste" in the process of [generating plutonium for nukes][] -- it was the cold war's nuclear arms race that brought us missions like [Voyager][] or [Cassini–Huygens][] and images like this[^armsrace]:

Luckily nukes have somewhat fallen out of favor recently, and with their decline (reduced production rate, at least) the serendipitous source of spacecraft-powering waste ran dry. What NASA does now is refine waste from nuclear power plants, but the process seems to be more expensive and less efficient.

I'm optimistic that some day we'll be able to visit the outer system without having to rely on byproducts of our ugliest, most awful excesses. At the moment -- sad but true -- we're not, and with NASA's[^nasa] shrinking budget Deep Space missions for the foreseeable future seem to be literally numbered.

[^mars]: Some missions to Mars are running on plutonium, too. [Curiosity][] is, and [Fobos-Grunt][] was meant to.
[^armsrace]: I'm not trying to defend the nuclear arms race. It would break my heart, but if I could I would trade Voyager, Curiosity and all the others for no nukes.
[^nasa]: I'm focusing on NASA because at the moment there's no going beyond Mars without them.
