Robert Walker:

>Venus cloud colonies are perhaps the most hospitable places in the solar system according to some measures. Far more hospitable than Mars, I'd say, and more hospitable than the Moon also though not so close to Earth or so easy to return to Earth from.

>Still, none of these places are anything like as hospitable as Antarctica where you can at least breath. Venus cloud colonies might perhaps be comparable to ideas for sea bed habitats on Earth, however - if the water supply and easy return of colonists to Earth issues can be solved.

>If so they are far more hospitable than Mars or the Moon, and may be our best bet for a second home for humanity in our solar system.

>We should however bear in mind that there have been almost no peer reviewed studies of this, just two papers in recent years. So it is necessary to keep an open mind about it. It is surely too soon to come to a final conclusion one way or the other.

I did know about the  idea of colonizing Venus's upper atmosphere with floating habitats a la Cloud City, but I did not know it was as feasible as this (rather extensive) article makes it out to be. It's certainly not easy by any conventional measure, but establishing a human outpost on Venus might be easier and more fruitful than doing the same on Mars.
