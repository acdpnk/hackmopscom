title: "LRO Images of Apollo 12 Landing Site"

[Last post][] reminded me of something. These images are a little older, but to my mind their awesomeness is hard to argue with and they're well worth sharing again.

{% include image.html src="apollo12-landing-site.jpg" description="Apollo 12 Landing Site, taken by LRO" link="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html#.VH8JJJ29KSN" %}

This is the Landing Site of [Apollo 12][], as seen from [LRO][], NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. ALSEP, left in the image, is a [package][] of scientific instruments left on site for long term measurements. Intrepid was the Apollo 12 Lunar Lander -- the "descent stage" near the image's center include the "legs" and the rocket motor used for decceleration, which are no longer needed and therefore left on the surface.

The most amazing thing about this image to my mind, however, are the astronaut footpaths. Human footprints on the Moon, left by [Alan Bean][] and [Pete Conrad][].

Also very interesting, in the lower <strike>left</strike> right[^lr], is [Surveyor 3][]. It's another spacecraft sent to the Moon more than 2 years earlier -- part of Apollo 12's mission was to land close and retrieve some of the samples it had collected and some parts of the spacecraft itself, and bring them back to earth.

{% include image.html src="conrad-surveyor3.jpg" description="Conrad, Surveyor 3 and Intrepid" link="http://dayton.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/LARGE/GPN-2000-001316.jpg" %}

Our protagonists (sans ALSEP) are in this awesome picture (from left to right): Surveyor 3, Conrad, Intrepid, and Bean behind the camera. Honorary mention to [Richard Gordon][], who at this time was babysitting the Command Module in circumlunar orbit.
