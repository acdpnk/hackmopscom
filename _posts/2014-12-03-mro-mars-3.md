>Hardware from a spacecraft that the Soviet Union landed on Mars in 1971 might appear in images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

>While following news about Mars and NASA's Curiosity rover, Russian citizen enthusiasts found four features in a five-year-old image from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that resemble four pieces of hardware from the Soviet Mars 3 mission: the parachute, heat shield, terminal retrorocket and lander. A follow-up image by the orbiter from last month shows the same features.

I realize  there's a whole lot of "could"s and "might"s and "possibly"s in that article. But even if it's *not* Mars 3 in these images, the fact that we can search for it -- and, importantly, that everyone can do it --  is amazing enough. Also, this is basically space archeology. Wow.
