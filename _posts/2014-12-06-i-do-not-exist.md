Mary Goodman:

>I am a supporting character in a Chuck Palahniuk novel, and it pains me to say that. Chuck loves failures. There are those that are rejected by everyone and repress it by pretending to believe in religion, thereby being superior to their rejectors. There are well intentioned mouth-breathers who keep a stiff upper lip no matter how much humiliation they endure. And then there is me. Most people just don’t like me. The reasons I am privy to are always vague. Life has mercy; I know am very good at failing, and secure in this. I survive, surprisingly comfortably, from the the work my parents give me and, unhindered by societal concepts of normalcy, freely navigating the tricks one can perform that teeter on the edge prostitution. Still, ultimately I am “financially insolvent,” in no small part because I talk like a Chuck Palahniuk narrator.

Fascinating account of a woman with Asperger's.
