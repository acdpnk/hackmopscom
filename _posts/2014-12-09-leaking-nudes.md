Lesli-Ann Lewis:

>The leaking of nude photographs, no matter how they are acquired, operates in much the same way as rape. It’s a tool of the violently misogynistic to disempower and to maintain a hierarchy where women do not even have ownership of themselves. Its goal is to silence, harm and warn.

>How we reacted to the leaked photographs of a married female celebrity engaging in consensual sex with her husband sends a very clear message to all girls and women: the only sex a “good” woman is allowed is secretive, shame-filled and coerced. Our reaction to the criminal act of leaking nudes also sends a message to abusers as well: their crimes are far more moral than female sexuality of any kind.
