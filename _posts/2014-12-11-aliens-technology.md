Tim Carmody:

>The chip/ship is the Nostromo, Ripley’s coffin/life-buoy, Ishmael-style, which is going to connect the threads between this movie and the previous picture. But even here, we already have the basic premise of the movie: space is hostile to life; human life is particularly fragile; technology is humanity’s bulwark against death.

I don't necessarily agree with all of Tim's assessments about the human/technology relationship, but this is a very well-written piece, and I thought it was very inspiring.
