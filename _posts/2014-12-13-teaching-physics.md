Preeya Phadnis:

>Physics classes are traditionally separated into two parts: lecture and recitation. Lecture is where you learn the concepts, like F=ma. Recitation is where you’re supposed to learn to apply those concepts to problems, like using F=ma to calculate the trajectory of a projectile. In practice, what happens in recitations is that professors will restate the concepts (“As you learned in lecture, F=ma”), give some very basic hints on the problems (“When doing problem 6, keep in mind that the given angle is not the usual angle given in these problems”), and maybe will do a couple of basic example problems out of the book. What they won’t do, even if asked, is teach students methods for solving the types of problems that have been assigned to them. I’m serious — physics professors *literally refuse* to teach students the skills they need to succeed in physics (or, at least, in physics classes). This isn’t an oversight. It’s felt that struggling with problem-solving, having to discover every technique for every problem on your own, forces better understanding of the material, builds character, and that it would just be a shame to deprive students of the amazing feeling you get when you suddenly realize how to do a problem after hours of struggling with it.

>The people who do really well in these classes are [...] the ones who don’t have to be taught these skills. It never occurs to them that something is missing from the traditional method of physics instruction, because, for them, nothing was missing. Why is this? Well, much of it is sheer grit — people work very, very hard to figure these skills out for themselves. Some of it is also about their willingness to approach professors and ask for help. Some of it is about outside help, because people come in with different levels of preparation, or because they have more outside resources to draw on (either financial or having easier access to expertise).

I used to study physics, and this is one of the reasons I quit.
