>It's difficult to talk about self-harm whatever the sufferer's gender, because it's an acute expression of something deeper. Crudely put, it's a way of making internal pain tangible, visible. If your skin burns and bleeds as you cut it open, you'll be distracted from the pain of your thoughts. This is a human trait, not a feminine one. It's genderless. Ageless. Age-old.
