Solstice is, to me, the most important date of winter[^solstice]. I do not particularly enjoy Christmas, New Years, or my birthday, but Solstice is special. Solstice means the light will come back. It means I made it through the worst. It means I'll survive.

In light of that, I think it's very appropriate that the newest member of my extended family chose this date as their birthday. You chose well, little one. I can not wait to meet you.

[^solstice]: I know that according to some it is actually the first day of winter. But my personal rhythm depends way more on light than temperatures, let alone calendars. Solstice has always felt like top of winter to me.
