Eleanor Thibeaux:

>Despite how often I was warned, when I first began my career as an audio post-production engineer, I didn’t fully understand how difficult the difficult parts of my career would be. But the great parts are even greater than I ever could have known. Like many women in male-dominated fields, I will have days where I am sure I cannot stomach the frustrations and stress of working right up against the gender gap, and I’ll ask myself yet again, “Why do I bother?” Well, I bother because I love the work, and I bother because I care. And if that’s not enough to fight the good fight another day longer, I’ll just have to remind myself that humanity landed a robot on a speeding comet, and some male scientist tried to outshine that achievement with an ugly shirt. I’m not trying to be a jerk or anything, but a lady scientist would have just dressed like a professional, and given the Philae Lander its day.

>I’m just saying.
