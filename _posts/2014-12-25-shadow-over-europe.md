>As a Muslim growing up in the west I am more scared now than ever before. My ancestral homelands are ravaged by war and terror. And my home in the west now also feels unsafe. Islamophobia isn’t something small and uncommon anymore. It’s become accepted as something not only common but as something good. I fear for the future. If people can sing carols while calling for the death of a billion people then how can I feel safe.
