>Experiences from as far north as Sweden and as far east as Japan show that policies promoting fathers’ involvement at home is good for the economy, for gender equality, and for families. And it’s good for men, too. A litany of studies demonstrate the positive effects of active fatherhood on men’s own health and well-being, their relationships with their partners, and on the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of their children.

Furthermore, after the birth of a first child women are more likely to return to the workforce in a part-time position than men are. The result: men’s incomes increase, women’s remain lower, and many women remain outside the formal labor market. The other result: we continue to see care-giving as women’s work, while men are seen, at best, as “helpers.”
