> I don’t think the tech industry has an asshole problem so much as a bystander problem. It is the main thing I ask of would-be allies. Don’t be a bystander. Don’t just sigh. Do.

It's far too easy to be a bystander, to sigh and think that you're better than them because *you* thought a sexist comment was obnoxious and out of place, and that that's enough. It's not. I've been a bystander too often. 

Over the last couple of years I've been -- slowly but surely -- learning to speak up, both for myself and others. In 2015, I'll further increase my efforts. Because I can, and because it's necessary.
