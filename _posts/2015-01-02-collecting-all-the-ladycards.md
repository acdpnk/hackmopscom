Apparently there's a game[^game] called "The Witcher" where you get a collectible card for every woman you have sex with. It goes without saying that *of course* you're playing as a white man and that *of course* you're out to fuck young, conventionally beautiful (and mostly white) women. It should be noted that fucking for cards is not what the game is about.

This is a series of blog posts documenting one gamer's quest to get as many cards as possible, complete with snappy (feminist) commentary. It's a depressing topic, but her writing is hilarious. Recommended. 

[^game]: I wouldn't know, I'm not a gamer.
