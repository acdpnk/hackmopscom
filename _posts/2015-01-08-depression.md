Today was the worst day I've had for some time. Over the last week or so a lingering head cold made some of my coping mechanisms harder, some impossible, and -- worst of all -- gave me the perfect excuse to let it slide. So, after a couple of days of my neglecting the rituals to keep it at bay, the demon struck.

The good thing about this is that I am well enough to blog. Through -- literally -- years of hard training I've become an expert at fighting this particular demon. If there was a black belt in depression wrestling, I'd totally get it.

There was a time not too long ago when I would bemoan the fact that after almost a decade of treatment in various forms, I still have to fight. Shouldn't this be over by now? Shouldn't I be cured?

No more. Yes, I still have to fight. Yes, I wish I didn't have to. But I'm winning these battles now, and that is not a small feat.
