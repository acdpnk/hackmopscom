>***A Parable***

>*Once my 6-year-old nephew came in to the living room and solemnly informed his parents that he did NOT accidentally set his bed on fire, but maybe they should go look at his bed. No reason, just it was a pretty interesting bed and they might want to have a look. He definitely didn't set it on fire or anything.*

>I've learned how to help myself. Now I'm going to learn how to let other people help me. In both cases, the key is to embrace my inner dingbat.

I've never been afraid to ask. The lesson I'm taking away from this great post, though, is that everyone else is as confused as I am at times.
