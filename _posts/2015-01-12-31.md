Today is my 31st birthday. I wanted to write something prfound, but I kept getting into sentimentalities that have no place outside a wine-fueled soul-baring discussion between close friends. Just kidding, I'd totally share all of the shit I'm thinking about, I'm just not able to put it into words in a way that does it justice.

So have this instead: I'm grateful. I'm grateful to all my friends, to all the great people I know, to everyone I met and talked to over the last year. You are all awesome. Me? I'm just happy to be alive.

Hugs and kisses.
