>As a doctor, I write stories all day. I see patients, distilling their lives into consults in a language rich with Latin and colorful syndromes. Patients are protagonists in their own novels, and with each patient visit, I write another chapter. They get married, divorced, have babies, switch gender, lose a hundred pounds, lives full of plot twists, romance, and intrigue. But, patients don't just come by to chat, they come for help. As soon as they step into the exam room, they are asking me to solve their problems - which makes me a mystery writer too.

>Let me explain. Join me, for a day in the life of a neurologist.
