Refrains like “The stupidity, it burns” are simply clichéd elements of a tired performance; Linus’s particular brand of banter — “paste-eaters”, “monkeys” — has nothing to do with the technical merit.  It’s the bluster of a bully, someone who can’t or won’t discuss a disagreement on equal terms, because he think he doesn’t have to.
