>As a social construct, programming languages are yet another channel for social bias to masquerade as “objective” and “technical” facts–and thus perpetuate existing social hierarchies. The community seems to have closed the loop on the recursive arguments “X and Y are the best languages because the smartest people use them” and “These are the smartest people because they use languages X and Y”

I, too, have hated on a variety of programming languages and those who write them. That said, don't do that. It's stupid, toxic behavior, as detailed in this article.

One caveat applies:

>Many of us like to think of the software industry as a meritocracy, rewarding those with the best skills who work the hardest. To truly achieve this[…]

[Meritocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy) is just as toxic an idea as dividing programming languages into those for "n00bs" vs. those for "men", maybe more so. Cut short: only those who have the privilege of free time (a.k.a. *money*) and social standing (a.k.a. *a penis*) will rise to the top in such a system, because they can afford to do prestigious (as opposed to paid) work and get the best education. So no, this is not something we should aspire to.
