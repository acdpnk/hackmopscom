>At a restaurant a few weeks ago, I heard a woman remark that high heels were designed by men to stop women from running away from them. I wanted to run over to that lady and tell her that history extends further back than 1920, but I couldn't because, you know, I was immobilized by my stilettos.

>Still, her take was simply not true. Not true at all. High heels were designed for men, worn by men, and actually had to be wrested away from men by women.
