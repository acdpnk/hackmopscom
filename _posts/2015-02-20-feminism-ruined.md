>I can’t watch television. Not since feminism happened. No more flopping on the couch with my loved ones for Mock The Week: I can’t get past the fact that all seven comedians are male. Though, admittedly, the only thing worse is when they get a token girl on and don’t let her speak. It’s no good changing the channel. Every other station is pumping out programming based on maddening gender stereotypes, putting it out into the collective mind of a populace that accepts the prejudice as if it is normal, as if it is perhaps the offshoot of innate genetic differences between men and women. Breathe. Breathe. Remember to breathe.
