New website, yay!

<!-- break -->

As my [first viable iOS App]({{site.base_url}}/projects/hmensaplus/) nears completion I realized I'd need an official website. I thought about using [acid.pink][], but it's become its own thing now and turning it into my "company" site would not do it justice. So here you are, hackmops.com.

I set the site up as a blog[^blog] because I wanted to start a devblog anyway, and the kind of technical posts I started writing over the last couple of months all stalled because it didn't feel right to post them to [ACIDPINK][acid.pink]. Hopefully I'll get to complete and post them here.

The site is still a little rough around the edges, but it was lots of fun to build and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. If you have any kind of feedback I'd be happy to hear from you -- pick whichever channel suits you best from the bottom of this page, or use the comments.

Speaking of comments: I decided to try comments (via [disqus][]). My jekyll installation allows me to include them selectively, so they won't be on every post or page, because I don't think every post should have comments. And if they turn into some kind of hellhole? They'll just go away.

Happy coding,<br />
Chris
