For my new App, [Stripped][], I wanted to have a [site][slowpage] I could use to demonstrate it's usefulness on.

Stripped is a Content Blocker for iOS that blocks *everything* but text, so that you can at least get the text of a website when your connection is too slow to usefully render full-featured sites. More on that in a later blogpost.

Anyway, for my App Preview and Screenshots I needed a [slow page][slowpage]. How do you do that? I'm sure there's JavaScript magic you can do to get a page to load really slow, or a bespoke web server configuration. But, to be honest, I'd rather not spend half a day on figuring *that* out. What I ended up using instead was [deelay.me](http://www.deelay.me/), a *"delay proxy for http ressources"*.

Say you want to slow the loading time of
```<img src="http://hackmops.com/assets/pic.png">```.
If you preface the url with a deelay url,
```<img src="http://deelay.me/1000/http://hackmops.com/assets/pic.png">```,
the load time will be delayed (in this case) by 1000 milliseconds.

**Bonus tip**: you can absolutely load a bogus script ressource for extra slowness, like so:

```<script src="http://deelay.me/5000/http://this.ressource/does/not/exi.st"></script>```
