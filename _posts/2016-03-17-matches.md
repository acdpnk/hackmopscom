When working with Erlang, Elixir and later Swift, I learned to love [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching), because it makes for nice, clean, readable code and just overall feels very *natural* to me.

JavaScript, of course, does not have pattern matching, but then it has hardly anything. Compared to e.g. Swift, which has an extensive standard library and (usually) all of CocoaTouch bundled with it, JS is downright spartan. This leads to completely different approaches to external dependencies â€” on iOS, you should think long and hard whether you really need them, especially if they're introducing language features. When you're writing JavaScript (or, more precisely, node), you won't get anything done without third party code. And thanks to npm, there's a plethora of packages to chose from.

Which brings me to [matches.js][], an npm package providing pattern matching features. I haven't done anything with it yet beyond playing around, but it looks very promising to me.
