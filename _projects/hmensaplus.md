HMensa+ is currently in Beta, if you're interested you can apply by simply sending me your email (via whichever channel you prefer, see below) and stating that you want to take part. I can't promise anything, since spots are limited, but I can probably accommodate you.

If you have questions, complaints, or feedback, the best way to get in contact is via [mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
