# Slow Loading Page

It's not the most beautiful page like this, but at least you can read it on a slow connection.

<h1>Some Bob Ross Quotes</h1>

<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://www.bobrosslipsum.com/">the Bob Ross Lorem Ipsum Generator</a>.</p>

<p>With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. If there are two big trees, eventually there will be a little tree.</p>

<p>Even the worst thing we can do here is good. There are no limits in this world. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first</p>

<p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>

<p>Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy</p>

<p>It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.</p>

<p>Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</p>

<p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. The light is your friend. Preserve it. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everybody needs a friend. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.</p>
