### Welcome to my Sandbox

If you are so inclined, you can find the [source on GitHub][].

I link stuff here. Since I can not possibly keep track of every page I link to, I do not take responsibility for what is on these pages. If there is a problem, please [contact][mail] me.

I also hope to write stuff here. Same as for links:

Problem â†’ [Mail][]

This site does not have comments. That is intentional. Comments are [<strike>evil</strike>][evil] not always helpful -- if you want to talk to me about something I wrote, you can contact me in any number of ways[^social]. If you like what I do, I'd love to hear from you. If I fucked up somehow, I very much want to know about that, too.

You can also post something somewhere else on the internet -- if I think it benefits the conversation, I'll be happy to link it.
